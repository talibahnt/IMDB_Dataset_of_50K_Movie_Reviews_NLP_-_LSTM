# IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews: Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## About the Dataset
IMDB Dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics.
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

For more dataset information, please go through the following link:

The dataset was pulled from Kaggle. The link is listed below:

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to perform a sentiment analysis on 50,000 movie reviews from the IMDB Dataset. Movies rely on consumers' sentiments to drive engagement through viewership and ticket sales, merchandising, social media, and other revenue streams.The metrics that I used to define and analyze "popularity" were:
-Sentiment Analysis
  - Positive Sentiment
  - Negative Sentiment
- Binary Classification
- Natural Language Processing
  - Representing text as numerical data
  - Reading a text-based dataset in pandas
  - Vectorizing our dataset
  - Building and evaluating a model
  - Comparing models
  - Examining a model for further insight
- Long Short-Term Memory
  - Text/sentiment Analysis
  - Natural Language Processing (text generation, translation)
  - Speech Recognition
- Best Fit Model
  - Long Short-Term Memory
  - Random Forest
  - LinearSVC
  - K-Neigbors
